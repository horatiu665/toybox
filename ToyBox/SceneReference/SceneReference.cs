//
// A wrapper that provides the means to safely serialize Scene Asset References.
// 
// Internally we serialize an Object to the SceneAsset which only exists at editor time.
// Any time the object is serialized, we store the path provided by this Asset (assuming it was valid).
// 
// This means that, come build time, the string path of the scene asset is always already stored, which if 
// the scene was added to the build settings means it can be loaded.
// 
// It is up to the user to ensure the scene exists in the build settings so it is loadable at runtime.
// To help with this, a custom PropertyDrawer displays the scene build settings state.
// 
// Known issues:
//     -   When reverting back to a prefab which has the asset stored as null, Unity will show the property 
//         as modified despite having just reverted. This only happens the fist time, and reverting again 
//         fixes it. Under the hood the state is still always valid, and serialized correctly regardless.
