# ToyBox

Welcome to ToyBox - a collection of C# scripts and tools for Unity I've been collecting, using and polishing since approx 2014. They are mostly dependency-free, except some of them use [DebugButton] because it makes life so much easier, even for a small tool. Some of them are mine, while some have been collected from other people over the internet. I'll try to describe them here so you know what you're getting into.
